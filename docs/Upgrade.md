# Migration from 2.x to 3.x

## Added things
- All Tools plugin stuff, that can be considered `require-dev` was added here, that includes some Shells and TestSuite classes.

## Removed things
- BaseConfig is not necessary anymore since now everything uses app.php configs.
- DebugTabs are now replaced by DebugKit plugin itself. Some more panels might be included soon.
